Wanted to jot down a quick description of the test app and the api endpoint recently pushed and merged in:

The test app is for algorithmic demonstrative purposes and to check that the algorithms written are working according to expectation;
its built using Dash app and currently demonstrates a simple radius search and a more involved regional search.

The api endpoit is not completely functional... It requires the main function under api/functions/vehicle retrieval to be slightly rewritten for
its current location.

Initial integration of test dataset started

Instructions for launching:
- run.py 
- main.py
